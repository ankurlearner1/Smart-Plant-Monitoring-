## 💻 How It Works

1. The **Soil Moisture Sensor** reads the soil level.
2. If the soil is **dry**, the relay turns **ON** and activates the **water pump**.
3. **DHT22** reads temperature & humidity.
4. A **Telegram Bot** sends messages like:
   - 🌡 Temperature: 28°C
   - 💧 Soil Moisture: 40%
   - 🚿 Pump Turned ON/OFF
5. The ESP32 sends regular updates.
